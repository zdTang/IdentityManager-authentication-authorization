     option 1: using ApplicationUser other than IdentityUser
               I am not very clear. We use a Model class called ApplicationUser which derive IdentityUser.
               and we have added a "Name" in it. so the Table has changed.
               if we still use IdentityUser as Type parameter, can we operate "Name" field?
               In a screenshot, it depicts the ERROR when using DI.   The registerd service is not same as the service we want to retrieve.
