     option 1: using ApplicationUser other than IdentityUser
               I am not very clear. We use a Model class called ApplicationUser which derive IdentityUser.
               and we have added a "Name" in it. so the Table has changed.
               if we still use IdentityUser as Type parameter, can we operate "Name" field?
               In a screenshot, it depicts the ERROR when using DI.   The registerd service is not same as the service we want to retrieve.
     
     option 2 : using IdentityUser as Type parameter, it still works.  Try to find out the reason.
               we have already added a new Extra field. so that it seems no problem to use a base class for representing the child class.

     About Validation: When use UserManager to create a new User, the "result" shows the password is not hard enough, and failed.
     At this moment, we can regard it as Server-side Error. 
     So that the so-called "Server-side" validation is not just the Server validate the coming View Model, but also includes the Error generated by operations
     We can append the generated Error on the ModelState, and then pass the Model back to frontEnd,  that Error will display with the "validation-summary" Tag

# 2-7 Display User's Name
      My approach: use User object to get necessary Information
      
      Instructor's Approach.   Using SignInManager and UserManager to get necessary Information from "User" object , Is it necessary? which one is best practice?

# 2-8 logIn View
      I don't think his approach is correct.

# 2-9 SignIn 
      They are several approaches to sign in, the difference is they need different parameters!
      Is there an approach which can describe why and what reason caused the failure.

      Authentication + Redirection
      when a un-signIn user try to access an action which required [Authenticate], it will be redirect to SignIn action.
      Who decide that I must go this URL? How to configure the setup?

      Be aware the difference between RedirectionToAction and Redirect
      use ViewData to pass value from backEnd-frontEnd-backEnd  (pass returnUrl)

#2-12 I don't think those returnUrl is useful for the Register Action(Get and Post)
      As there is no returnUrl will be passed into these two Action. 
      While for Login Action. once a un-login user try to access an Action with [Authenticate], the request will be redirect to Login Action and the ReturnUrl will be passed here directly.

      use  LocalRedirect() to avoid bad redirection!
      return LocalRedirect(returnUrl??Url.Content("~/"));
