     option 1: using ApplicationUser other than IdentityUser
               I am not very clear. We use a Model class called ApplicationUser which derive IdentityUser.
               and we have added a "Name" in it. so the Table has changed.
               if we still use IdentityUser as Type parameter, can we operate "Name" field?
               In a screenshot, it depicts the ERROR when using DI.   The registerd service is not same as the service we want to retrieve.
     
     option 2 : using IdentityUser as Type parameter, it still works.  Try to find out the reason.
               we have already added a new Extra field. so that it seems no problem to use a base class for representing the child class.

     About Validation: When use UserManager to create a new User, the "result" shows the password is not hard enough, and failed.
     At this moment, we can regard it as Server-side Error. 
     So that the so-called "Server-side" validation is not just the Server validate the coming View Model, but also includes the Error generated by operations
     We can append the generated Error on the ModelState, and then pass the Model back to frontEnd,  that Error will display with the "validation-summary" Tag
